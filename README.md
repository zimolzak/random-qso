# Random CW QSO

Generate random lines of dialog that are often sent in a Morse code
ham radio contact.

This is so I can feed it into the excellent `ebook2cw` software or
similar, to practice listening to Morse code. Use simple generative
rules and random selection to keep things interesting. We generate
random details about the other station, including:

- RST signal report
- operator's name
- city and state
- weather
- their make/model of radio
- straight key century club (SKCC) number to exchange
- idiomatic parts of the conversation like how they start/end a transmission.
